## About Chingu

If you aren’t yet a member of Chingu we invite you to join us. We help our members transform what they’ve learned in courses & tutorials into the practical experience employers need and want.

Our remote team projects let you refine your technical skills and put them into practice while gaining new “soft” skills like communication, collaboration, and Agile project management. The types of skills that help real-world teams get things done!

You can learn more and join us at chingu.io.

## Instructions

General instructions for all Pre-Work Projects can also be found in the Chingu Voyage Handbook (URL posted in the #read-me-first channel on Discord).

This tier focuses on frontend only so there will be no backend server involved. There will potentially be tier 1 and tier 3 versions in the future though!
